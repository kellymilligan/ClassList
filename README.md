Reusable classes for working with different canvas contexts

## Canvas
Standardized setup class for working with the canvas 2d context, abstracting away some of the more annoying bits. Allows you to focus on the primary `draw()` call

## Three
Standardized setup class for working with THREE scenes. Provides abstraction for common setup steps, and provides hooks for different lifecycle stages of the class. 

## Shader2d
A super duper simple, reusable, vanilla WebGL class for rendering a fragment shader. Useful for when all you want is to render your GLSL on-screen.
